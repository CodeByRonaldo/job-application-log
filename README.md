were successful or unsuccessful.

# Diary
- 2024-Dec-17: Creating the frontend is hard to do without the use of React, I have to make the homepage of the website with only html, css, and javascript but it was showing some difficulty. Approxiately used 75% of my free today working on the project trying to make the website without the framework, but conceded because I felt that I was wasting time so I redid everything and installed the react library and used the default CRA template to keep it as "raw" as possible. In the future, I need to touchup HTML, CSS (suprisingly hard because CSS require some math skills to get the "responsive" website I want to recreate like what major websites did for example; Youtube, Linkedin, and Reddit), and Javascript (I'm more familiar and at the moment my favorite to work with...). After this project.
