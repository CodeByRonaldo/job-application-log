# Diary
### 2024-Dec-17:
Creating the frontend is hard to do without the use of React, I have to make the homepage of the website with only html, css, and javascript but it was showing some difficulty. Approxiately used 75% of my free today working on the project trying to make the website without the framework, but conceded because I felt that I was wasting time so I redid everything and installed the react library and used the default CRA template to keep it as "raw" as possible. In the future, I need to touchup HTML, CSS (suprisingly hard because CSS require some math skills to get the "responsive" website I want to recreate like what major websites did for example; Youtube, Linkedin, and Reddit), and Javascript (I'm more familiar and at the moment my favorite to work with...). After this project.

Pretty productive day considering I allocate 3 hours of my day to work on this project. Today, I made the home page, which can be finalized at any time that I want to but I will get there when I am done polishing the backend functionalities if I could reach there. I also made the header which was pretty fun to work with because I took inspiration from other websites like Linkedin, Reddit, and Youtube that have their nav items close to the center of the screen rather than stretching it out from edge-to-edge. That was a pretty nice touch to improve the user's experience. Same with the home page, I can finalized the header at any time after polishing the backend functionalities, I will be exciting to continue learning how to improve UX with simple CSS styling.
